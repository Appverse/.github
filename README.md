## Open Letter to the Appverse Community

Dear Appverse community,

I am writing to inform you that the Appverse project is coming to an end. We will be leaving all of our code publicly available at [https://github.com/Appverse](https://github.com/Appverse) and [https://github.com/Appverse-archive](https://github.com/Appverse-archive), but we will no longer be maintaining or contributing to the project.

This was the right desicion as it is not longer needed as an active project, there are other projects that have grown to fill this gap. We are grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project with all of you, and we are proud of what we have accomplished together.

Appverse has been an incredible experience for us and for all of the contributors. It has been a learning process like no other, and it has taught us so much about open source software development, team collaboration, and the importance of community.

We all have learned so much from our fellow contributors. We have not only learned new coding techniques, but also new ways to think about problems, and new ways to collaborate with others. 

We are grateful for the opportunity to have worked on a project that even it was small it was used to solve real problems. Appverse has helped people to build and share their own applications.

We would like to thank all of the contributors to Appverse and specially the Project Founder [carloslozano](https://github.com/orgs/Appverse/people/carloslozano). Without your dedication and hard work, this project would not have been possible. We are also grateful to the Appverse community for your support and feedback.

Thank you for making Appverse a success.

Sincerely,
The Appverse Team
